# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction

This project focuses on predicting passenger satisfaction based on various factors such as in-flight wifi service, seat comfort, cleanliness, and scheduling-related attributes like departure and arrival times. Using machine learning techniques, the model classifies customer satisfaction into different levels.

## Key Features:

* **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
* **Model Selection**: Evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to identify the best-performing model.
* **Model Performance**: Achieved high performance with the following evaluation metrics:
  * **Precision**: 0.96
  * **Recall**: 0.95
  * **F1-Score**: 0.95
* **Tools and Libraries**: Utilized **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**, and **Matplotlib** for data analysis, model development, and visualization.

## Project Structure:

* `data/`: Raw and cleaned data files.
* `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Installation:
