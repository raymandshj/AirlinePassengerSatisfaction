# AirlinePassengerSatisfaction
Airline passenger satisfaction prediction using machine learning. The project preprocesses data, trains models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost), and evaluates performance, achieving precision of 0.96, recall of 0.95, and F1-score of 0.95. Built with Pandas, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost.

This project focuses on predicting passenger satisfaction based on various factors such as in-flight wifi service, seat comfort, cleanliness, and scheduling-related attributes like departure and arrival times. Using machine learning techniques, the model classifies customer satisfaction into different levels.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Model Selection: Evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to identify the best-performing model.
Model Performance: Achieved high performance with the following evaluation metrics:
Precision: 0.96
Recall: 0.95
F1-Score: 0.95
Tools and Libraries: Utilized Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and Matplotlib for data analysis, model development, and visualization.
